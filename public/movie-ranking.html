<h1>The Best Movies According to Utkarsh</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite. Somthing i can watch again and again. The special effects and the storyline are amazing.</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>This movie from my childhood days reminds me of how i built interest in computer science. They show a graphical interface of unix system back in the 80s being that one of Hammond's Grandchildren operates and it was fascinating to see.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Most mind bending movie ever and everytime i watch it i experience a new ascpect of the storyline, it is a must watch.</p>
